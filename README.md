:Introduction
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square with their symbol (traditionally X and O), aiming to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

This project provides a basic implementation of the game, allowing players to play against each other.

:Features
Simple command-line interface.
Two players can play against each other.
Basic validation to ensure moves are legal.
Usage
To play the game, simply run the main script. Follow the prompts to take turns and enter your moves.

:bash
python tictactoe.py // copy it
The game will display the current board after each move and announce the winner or declare a draw when appropriate.

bash
git clone https://github.com/sakshamk2003/tic-tac-toe.git
Navigate to the project directory:
